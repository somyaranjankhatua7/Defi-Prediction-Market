# DEFI Prediction Market
A decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to create and participate in prediction markets. Users can bet on the outcome of various events (such as questions with Yes/No answers), where they predict results and earn rewards based on the correctness of their predictions.

## Features:
* Decentralized Question Creation: Verified users can create prediction questions with customizable betting options and timeframes.
* Secure Betting: Users place bets directly on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring trustless transactions.
* Outcome Setting: After the event concludes, verified users set the outcome, determining the winners based on the correct predictions.
* Automated Payouts: Winnings are automatically distributed to users who made the correct predictions, based on the total pool and their stake.
* Transparency & Security: All transactions, questions, and outcomes are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring full transparency and security.
* Gas Optimized: The contract is optimized for gas fees to ensure minimal cost for users interacting with the DApp.

This project aims to provide a decentralized, open-source framework for prediction markets on Ethereum, creating a secure, trustless, and transparent betting platform for users.
